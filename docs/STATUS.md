# STATUS

Part 8 of the brief is the *project's* definition of done, not any one
session's. This maps each item to its actual state, so nothing is quietly
assumed complete.

Last updated 2026-09-20.

| # | Part 8 item | State | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Every document in Part 6 exists | **Done** | `docs/`, 9 documents + 10 ADRs |
| 2 | `ASSUMPTIONS` block, every default chosen where the brief was silent | **Done** | `docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md`, 23 entries |
| 3 | All soft spots in `RISK_REGISTER.md` with a costed patch each | **Done** | `docs/RISK_REGISTER.md`, all 20 |
| 4 | **S1 resolved**: measured resolver reach, fallback trigger recorded | **Done for v0.1.** Hand-audited on two independent samples; 72.0% on the fresh one. A third audit is required before any v1.0 gate claim (A-34) | `trellis-index/src/resolve.rs`, `BENCHMARK_AND_EVAL.md` §2 |
| 5 | **S14 resolved**: named benchmark repo, threshold with reasoning | **Done** | `BENCHMARK_AND_EVAL.md` §1, §3 |
| 6 | **S16 resolved**: the recall figure that fires the pivot | **Done** — 60% | ADR 0002, `ROADMAP.md` |
| 7 | **S7 resolved**: model floor across seven metrics | **Rig built, first configuration measuring.** `docs/bench/run_floor.py` drives the real adapter against a candle-backed llama.cpp-compatible probe | `BENCHMARK_AND_EVAL.md` §5, `docs/bench/run_floor.py` |
| 8 | **S17 resolved**: llguidance embedded, inference path in an ADR, licence verified, matrix published | **Mostly.** Embedded and tested; licence verified MIT 1.8.0; matrix published. **Inference path deliberately open** | ADR 0006, `TECH_SPIKE.md` §3 |
| 9 | Grounding contract structural — `Verdict` unforgeable, `ToolResult` has no pass variant | **Done** | `trellis-checks/src/verdict.rs`, `trellis-loop/src/tools.rs` |
| 10 | One main loop with tools, not a verification fan-out, ADR says why | **Done.** Both halves of the v0.2 exit condition demonstrated: a converging run, and a model declaring success while the checks disagree | ADR 0005, `trellis-loop/src/agent.rs` |
| 11 | Multi-agent parallelizes work only, ADR says why | **Done in design and rules; no concurrent execution yet** | ADR 0005, `trellis-loop/src/partition.rs` |
| 12 | Partitioning treats unresolved/candidate edges as unpartitionable; integrated checks never skipped | **Rule 1 implemented and property-tested over 400 seeds, now against a real resolver rather than synthetic graphs. Rule 2 documented; enforced when integration is built** | `partition::plan`, `tests/partition_invariants.rs` |
| 13 | `trellis doctor` reports batching capability and multi-agent tier | **Done.** Probes the runtime rather than reporting a default; verified reporting `RuntimeConstrained` against a live server | `trellis-model/src/tier.rs`, `trellis-model/src/runtime.rs` |
| 14 | Rollback verified by induced mid-run failure in CI | **Verified in the test suite. No CI configured yet** | `trellis-vcs/src/lib.rs` tests |
| 15 | Bidirectionality verified by property test | **Done** — 199 random graphs | `trellis-index/tests/bidirectional.rs` |
| 16 | v1.0 gate verbatim in `ROADMAP.md`, all five conditions | **Done** | `ROADMAP.md` |
| 17 | v1.0 non-goals explicit and substantial | **Done** — 10 entries | `ROADMAP.md` |
| 18 | Every major technology choice has a recorded rejected alternative | **Done** | ADRs 0001–0010 |
| 19 | Factual claims cited; unverifiable ones flagged | **Done** | `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`, final section |
| 20 | No marketing language anywhere | **Done** | — |

## The measurement (resolves S1's reach; S16 fired, then averted)

Benchmark: poetry 2.5.0 sdist, SHA-256 in `01-v0.1-measure.md` §2.

| | first measurement | after the ADR 0012 backstop |
|---|---|---|
| Recall, seed 20260919 (n=159) | **47.8%** | **67.9%** |
| Recall, seed 20260920 (n=100, fresh) | — | **72.0%**, CI [63.2%, 80.8%] |
| Precision | 100% | **100%** |
| Mechanical soundness check | 4,443/4,443 | **5,908/5,908** |

47.8% fired the pre-registered S16 pivot trigger. The owner chose one bounded
backstop over the pivot (ADR 0011 option C, recorded as a deliberate deviation
in ADR 0012). Receiver typing cleared 60% on a **fresh** sample, confirmed
against the original, so **the pivot does not execute**.

**The S1 fallback band (60–85%) now applies.** The blast-radius guarantee
survives; a further backstop is required before v1.0 can claim it.

Three unsound edges appeared during the attempt and all three were fixed, each
at a cost in recall. The third was found only by the fresh sample: an
annotation that was simply wrong, with a *sibling* class overriding the method.
Annotations are evidence about the runtime type, never proof.

Findings that stand regardless:

- The deficit is in `Attribute` call sites. `Name` resolves at 84.7%.
- The brief expected `DecoratorIndirection` to dominate the misses. It is 3
  sites out of 11,233, against 10,646 for `MethodDispatchUntyped`.
- 51% of first-party misses cite pytest fixtures.

## The three that are genuinely open

Items 4, 7 and 10 still cannot be closed by writing documents. Item 4 now needs
only the audit scored. Items 7 and 10 need a working inference path and a
working agent loop, and both are v0.2.

## What was verified rather than assumed

- tree-sitter 0.27.0 pairs correctly with tree-sitter-python 0.25.0 at runtime
  (`tests/grammar_abi.rs`). The brief warns about this and it is now a test.
- llguidance 1.8.0 is MIT and actively maintained (upstream push 2026-09-04).
- `github/stack-graphs` is **archived**. Not an S1 option.
- `Kixiron/lasso` last shipped 2024-08-19. Replaced with a 40-line interner.
- `bincode` 3.0.0 is a protest release that deliberately fails to compile.
- `poetry.core` is a separate distribution, absent from the poetry tree, and
  imported 379 times. Treating it as first-party on the strength of its root
  package put those calls in the recall denominator as misses.

## Where the brief's own text needed correcting

- **llguidance API.** The brief's three-call sketch omits `CommitResult`'s
  `backtrack` and `ff_tokens`. Neither is optional: fast-forward tokens are a
  throughput win, backtracking is correctness. ADR 0006, `TECH_SPIKE.md` §3.
- **`Verdict` serialization.** A derived `Deserialize` would be a public
  constructor from arbitrary JSON, defeating the seal and opening the S10 hole.
  `Verdict` is `Serialize`-only; trails read back as inert `RecordedCheck`.
- **The dominant miss reason.** The brief predicts decorator indirection will
  dominate and it does not, by three orders of magnitude (above).

## Closed since the last update

`RadiusReport::coverage.unresolved` was structurally always zero: a reverse
walk cannot see an unresolved edge, because such an edge names no target and
never enters `reverse`. The radius now takes its unresolved count from the
files it touches — an over-approximation, which is the safe direction. Closes
OPEN_QUESTIONS Q-13.

## Next, in order

1. **S6 degradation UX, and it is a correctness problem, not a polish one.**
   `trellis radius Factory` prints *"92 of 2474 first-party call sites resolved
   (3.7%)"*. The numerator counts sites that reach `Factory`; the denominator
   counts every unbindable site in the files the radius touches. They are
   different populations, and dividing one by the other produces a figure that
   means nothing while reading as the resolver's reach — which the audit puts
   at 72%. The same line is handed to the model. Splitting the radius's
   coverage from the index's, so the two facts can never be divided, comes
   before any work on collapsing the 2,382-item list.
2. **The model floor (S7), remainder.** The first configuration is measuring.
   The second (Qwen2.5-Coder-3B) is still downloading.
3. **v0.3, remainder.** Trail writing, committing and `resume` are built. Left:
   the context file, governance-rule import, and feeding prior context into
   the loop as a starting state rather than only printing it.
4. **A further backstop for the 85% gate.** Evidence points at `conftest.py`
   fixture return types and return-type propagation. Not to be started against
   samples already scored twice.
5. **A human re-audit before any v1.0 gate claim** (A-34, Q-15), sized on the
   expected first-party count: ~1,000 draws for 400 in the denominator.
6. **A test for the converging path.** Every test in `trellis-loop` asserts a
   refusal to converge. The positive case was demonstrated by hand against a
   demo repository and is not defended by anything in the suite, so a change
   that broke convergence outright would pass.
7. Deferred: Q-14's latent unsound edge on the self-dispatch path.

## What the last iteration found

**S20's patch was described in three documents and absent from the code.**
Commit `e99b375` says "Patched: `CheckConfig::default` now passes
`--no-incremental`". `RISK_REGISTER.md` says "Patch, applied." `Q-17` says
"The default now passes `--no-incremental`, which fixes mypy."
`crates/trellis-checks/src/lib.rs` was not in that commit, and the default was
a bare `vec!["mypy"]`.

So for several commits the repository asserted, in the document whose whole job
is an honest account of residual risk, that a hazard was closed while every
default run reopened it. S20 is the case where a `Verdict` passes on code the
checker never read; the register is exactly where someone would look to find
out whether it still can. Fixed, with the reasoning moved into the source and
two tests — one asserting the flag, one asserting TRELLIS does **not** append
it to a command the user configured, because a verdict about an invocation the
user never wrote is the same dishonesty inverted.

Worth generalising: a claim in a document is not evidence the code does it, and
this one survived a passing test suite, a clippy-clean build and a review of
its own commit message. Anything in `RISK_REGISTER.md` marked "applied" should
name the test that would fail if it were reverted.

## Recently closed

- Incremental update: single-file save **39.7 ms p50**, 3.1× a cold build,
  with a property test asserting an updated session equals a cold one.
- CI, including a named job for v1.0 gate condition 4.
- ADR 0013, settling the inference path S17 left open.
- Orchestrator actor and the agent loop, both tested without a model.
- `trellis run`, with **both halves of the v0.2 exit condition demonstrated**:
  a converging run, and a model that declares success while the checks
  disagree — rolled back to a byte-identical tree.
- `.trellis/config.toml` is now actually read. It was documented as the source
  of check commands while nothing loaded it, so a repository could configure
  its checks and be silently ignored.
- The model adapter, tiers 2 and 4, against llama.cpp, vLLM and SGLang.
- 20 verified model-floor tasks on the benchmark corpus.
- `trellis doctor` probes rather than reporting defaults (S17, S18).
- **v0.3 trail and resume**: written after rollback so failures are recorded,
  committed so the next run can start and no later rollback deletes them, and
  read back as `UntrustedTrail` with judgment fenced (S10, S11).
- **The S7 floor runner** (`docs/bench/run_floor.py`), and four ways it could
  have measured nothing: LF anchors against a CRLF corpus (all twenty tasks
  skip, reported as a clean run), resetting to HEAD while HEAD accumulates
  defects, scoring from the run's own verdict rather than re-checking, and
  running the checker from the wrong directory. Each produces a plausible
  report rather than an error.
